###Pennies: A Virtual Piggy Bank and Indivisible Crypto Currency. 



*****

**As of January 1st 2014 at 00:00:00 GMT Pennies will not connect to any client
older than v0.10.0.0**

Seven days after (8th January 2014 at 00:00:00 GMT), the new stake percentage 
took effect. After a few hiccups this has resulted in a massive reduction to 
prevent further over inflation from this point forward.

Pennies are straightforward cryptographic coins. They are based on YaCoin and use
Scrypt-Jane to encourage CPU-centric mining. They are designed to mint Proof of 
Stake blocks easily and encourage saving. They have no decimals and no micro or nano
units--every penny is a single coin! 

Minting of shiny new pennies can be done using the Command Line Banking Virtual 
Teller Window within the Piggy Bank. Freshly minted coins take 25 blocks to mature.
Pennies are not meant to have specific value or be keyed to a specific value in any
fiat or electronic currency. Pennies are a free-market cryptocurrency and are worth
simply what the market determines their worth to be. 

Due to the uniqueness of indivisibility a few interesting challenges are posed to the 
crypto-currency community through Pennies. How might fees work at an exchange? How does
pool minting work if the block reward is 1 and it can't be broken down? Pennies are meant
to be simple to use, save, and transfer for beginners--and simultaneously enable advanced 
crypto-currency users quick, non-nonsense interaction via Command Line Banking.
